                    IMPORTANT DISCLAIMERS
                </H2>
                <p className={styles.mb10}>
                    Our App is designed to assist with optimizing and managing the storage and performance of your
                    device through features such as duplicate photo removal, video compression, file organization, and
                    more. By using our Service, you acknowledge and agree to the following disclaimers:
                </p>
                <p className={styles.mb10}>
                    <strong>For Informational Purposes Only.</strong> Our Service helps you manage storage, monitor security risks, and improve device functionality but is not a substitute for professional data management, IT support, security monitoring, or technical services. You should not rely on our Service as the sole method for managing critical data or resolving technical or security issues.
                </p>
                <p className={styles.mb10}>
                    <strong>Accuracy.</strong> Our features, including photo and video management, duplicate file removal, data leak checks, and contact organization, rely on AI algorithms, device settings, file metadata, and third-party services. Accuracy may be affected by factors such as device settings, file permissions, network conditions, and external integrations. The Service does not guarantee that all issues (such as duplicate files, data leaks, or ad-blocking) will be completely resolved or identified accurately. Delays, inaccuracies, or missed items may occur, and you should verify important files and data through alternative methods if necessary.
                </p>
                <p className={styles.mb10}>
                    <strong>Data Leak Checker.</strong> Our Service includes a data leak checker to help identify if your personal information has been exposed in data breaches. This feature scans public databases for compromised data associated with your email address. While the data leak checker may help identify exposed data, it does not guarantee complete protection from data breaches or leaks. We recommend that you take additional security measures, such as using strong passwords, and regularly monitoring your accounts for unusual activity. Our Service is not a comprehensive security tool and should be used alongside other security practices.
                </p>
                <p className={styles.mb10}>
                    <strong>Add Blocker.</strong> Our Service provides an ad blocker to help remove unwanted advertisements while browsing or using certain third-party apps. The effectiveness of the ad blocker may vary depending on the apps and websites you use. The ad blocker may not be able to block all ads, and its performance may be affected by device settings, app configurations, or changes in third-party ad systems. We are not responsible for any issues caused by ad blockers or for ads that are not blocked by the Service.
                </p>
                <p className={styles.mb10}>
                    Payment will be charged to the payment method you submitted at the time of purchase at confirmation of purchase (after you confirm by single-touch identification, facial recognition, or entering your payment method details on the web, or otherwise accepting subscription terms provided on the payment screen or on the pop-up screen provided by Apple/Google or on our web page) or after the end of the trial period. You authorize us to charge the applicable subscription fees to the payment method that you use.
                </p>
                <p className={styles.mb10}>
                    <strong>Secret Space.</strong> The Secret Space feature allows you to store sensitive files in a protected area on your device. This feature is intended to provide extra security for your personal data by restricting access to selected files. While we aim to provide a secure space for your files, we do not guarantee absolute protection. The security of the Service relies on your device’s security settings, and we strongly recommend that you configure your device’s security features (such as biometric or password protection) to prevent unauthorized access. We are not responsible for any breaches of data security.
                </p>
                <p className={styles.mb10}>
                    <strong>Battery Features.</strong> Our Service offers charging animations, battery widgets, and battery tips to help you monitor and optimize your device’s battery life. These features are designed to assist with monitoring and improving battery efficiency but may not have a significant impact on battery lifespan. While we provide battery optimization tips and tools, we cannot guarantee a specific increase in battery life. Battery performance can vary based on device hardware, usage habits, and environmental factors. Always ensure that your device is running the latest operating system updates and follow any manufacturer recommendations for optimal battery care.
                </p>
                <p className={styles.mb10}>
                    <strong>Photo Categorization.</strong> Our Service utilizes a native framework to categorize user photos, helping to organize and manage images more efficiently. This feature is powered by AI algorithms to detect and sort photos based on content, but the categorization may occasionally have limitations, such as errors or missed files. Users should always review their photos before proceeding with any deletion to avoid accidental loss of important files.
                </p>
                <p className={styles.mb10}>
                    <strong>File Management and Data Deletion.</strong>  While our Service helps identify and remove unwanted files, including photos, videos, and screenshots, we do not guarantee that all deletions will be reversible. Once deleted, files may not be recoverable. We recommend that you review the files before proceeding with any deletion to avoid accidental loss of important data. We do not provide backup services, and you are responsible for ensuring that important data is backed up properly before using the app for file management.
                </p>
                <p className={styles.mb10}>
                    <strong>Data Security.</strong> We implement reasonable measures to protect user data, but we do not guarantee absolute security. Data breaches, unauthorized access, or service disruptions may occur despite our best efforts. Users should exercise caution when sharing sensitive information through the Service and use strong security settings where available.
                </p>
                <p className={styles.mb10}>
                    <strong>Third-Party Integrations.</strong> Our App integrates with third-party services, such as cloud storage providers, file management platforms, ad networks, and security services. We do not control the accuracy, performance, availability, or reliability of these third-party services. Any inaccuracies, malfunctions, or discrepancies in third-party data that impact App functioning are beyond our control, and we disclaim any responsibility for errors, omissions, or inconsistencies arising from such integrations. You should independently verify any important data obtained through third-party services. Please note that third-party services are subject to their own terms of use and privacy policies, which govern the collection and use of your data, so we strongly recommend reviewing corresponding documents.
                </p>
                <p className={styles.mb10}>
                    <strong>Your responsibility.</strong> You acknowledge and agree that we bear no liability for any claims, losses, liabilities, injuries, or damages, whether actual or alleged, resulting from your use, reliance on, or interpretation of any information or Content provided through our Service. The App is a supplementary tool for managing device storage, security, and optimization, but you must take independent steps to ensure the safety of your data and verify important files before deletion. Your decision to use the Service is entirely voluntary, and you assume full responsibility and all associated risks. Users must ensure that their use of the Service complies with applicable data privacy and protection laws, and they are responsible for any consequences resulting from the deletion or management of files.

                <p className={styles.mb10}>
                    In the event of a dispute arising from or relating to these Terms, you and the Company will first attempt to resolve the matter through negotiations.

Participation in ADR is not mandatory and is entirely at the discretion of each party. If ADR is unsuccessful within 60 days, or if a party refuses to participate, the dispute may proceed to arbitration. European consumers (including those in Norway, Switzerland, Iceland, or Liechtenstein) may use the European Commission’s Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) platform for disputes related to online contracts.
