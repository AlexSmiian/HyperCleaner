                    The personal data we maintain will primarily be stored and processed within the EU. We will do our best to keep this personal data secure. All information we hold is stored on our secure servers (which we own or license from appropriate third parties). We use industry-standard procedures and security standards to prevent unauthorized access to our servers.
                </p>
                <p className={styles.mb10}>
                    However, there may arise situations where we need to collaborate with trusted third parties located outside the EU to deliver services and subscriptions to you (for instance, when utilizing servers in the US). We choose our processors very carefully. We do not work with processors based in countries where we are concerned about the rule of law with respect to privacy.
                </p>
                <p className={styles.mb10}>
                    We have entered into Standard Contractual Clauses with all non-EEA third parties whose data processing tools we use (data processors) if there is no adequacy decision by the EU Commission for their particular country. We adhere to the principles of minimization and anonymization, where feasible, to ensure compliance with the GDPR and other relevant data privacy laws when transferring personal data, if necessary.
                </p>
                <p className={styles.mb10}>
                    By providing your personal data, you explicitly consent to its transfer, storage, or processing outside the EU. We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that this information is handled securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
